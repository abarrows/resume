# Andrew Barrows Resume

This repo serves as a single source of truth for my resume and related
information.  There are a few main benefits I see in keeping it centralized here
within github.

1. Using Markdown primarily keep the contents of my resume as simple as
   possible.
2. Version controlled edits ensures I can retrieve old history and avoid the
   *resume_20240104, resume_20240106, etc.* in a cloud folder.
3. Automation abilities like generating different formats and later on a
   template so it looks a little more polished than pure markdown.
4. Linting, spell checking, formatting, indentation, etc.
