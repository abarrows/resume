Dear Paul Wright,

Ryan VanMaele, an EquipmentShare engineer in billing, encouraged me to apply for your Engineering Manager position.  We have worked together in the past and have remained good friends.  I've always identified with EquipmentShare's People First culture but became inspired when Ryan shared insights into this role and it's mission. He described some of the innovative strides your team has made on the T3 tech while under your leadership.  Paul, your dedication to empowering engineers while fostering a growth mindset culture, deeply resonates with my own professional ethos.

At Andrews McMeel Universal, I was fortunate enough to create the company's first Front-end Engineering Team from the ground up.  Through delivering excellent digital products and features, our team grew from 3 to 11 engineers.  I worked extremely hard rostering a diverse and inclusive team, shoring up blind spots and complimenting the team as a whole. Throughout the department, we gained a reputation for being the "principle software engineering team" both in culture and performance.  This aligns closely with EquipmentShare's approach to fostering an environment where engineering creativity and excellence are at the forefront of product development.

I am eager to bring my technical expertise and strategic insights to your engineering team. I am confident that my servant leadership style and thorough understanding of technical architecture will drive your engineering teams to new heights along the way to realizing your vision.

Paul, I look forward to the opportunity to further discuss how I can contribute to EquipmentShare's continued success. Thank you for considering my application.

Warm regards,

Andrew Barrows
