Dear [HIRING MANAGER],

[REFERRAL], an engineer at [REFERRAL DEPARTMENT], encouraged me to apply for your [POSITION] position.  We have worked together in the past and have remained good friends.  I've always identified with [COMPANY_NAME]'s culture but became inspired when [REFERRAL] shared insights into this role and it's mission. [REFERRAL_PRONOUNS] described some of the innovative strides your team has made on the [POSITION_TEAM] while under your leadership.  [HIRING MANAGER], your dedication to empowering engineers while fostering a growth mindset culture, deeply resonates with my own professional ethos.

At Andrews McMeel Universal, I was fortunate enough to create the company's first Front-end Engineering Team from the ground up.  Through delivering excellent digital products and features, our team grew from 3 to 11 engineers.  I worked extremely hard rostering a diverse and inclusive team, shoring up blind spots and balancing the team dynamic and strengths. Throughout the department, we gained a reputation for being the "principle software engineering team" both in culture and performance.  This aligns closely with [COMPANY_NAME]'s approach to fostering an environment where engineering creativity and excellence are at the forefront of product development.

I am eager to bring my technical expertise and strategic insights to your engineering team. I am confident that my servant leadership style and thorough understanding of technical architecture will drive your engineering teams to new heights along the way to realizing your vision.

[HIRING MANAGER], I look forward to the opportunity to further discuss how I can contribute to [COMPANY_NAME]'s continued success. Thank you for considering my application.

Warm regards,

**[CANDIDATE_NAME]**
