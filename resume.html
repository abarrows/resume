    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Led front-end engineering architecture and development across 15+ key
        websites and services,
        <strong
          >culminating in a peak of 8.6 million monthly user impressions</strong
        >
        while managing Software Engineers across three product teams.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong
          >Supervised front-end operations delivering over 16,000+ digital
          assets monthly,</strong
        >
        including comics, games, and puzzles for prestigious clients like Apple,
        Amazon, and USA Today directly supporting over a million dollars in
        revenue.
      </li>
      <li>
        Played an key role in company-wide AI adoption. Through extensive
        training and usage of enterprise level models like GitHub CoPilot,
        Gemini Pro, and ChatGPT,
        <strong>corporate AI integration guidelines were development</strong> in
        collaboration with technical leadership.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong
          >Reduced hosting cost by 60% by facilitating a 5-year cloud migration
          plan to Azure.</strong
        >
        Transitioned 20+ digital products and 40+ web services to boost
        operational efficiency, scalability, and security within our digital
        ecosystem while coordinating front-end efforts with DevOps.

      <li>
        <strong
          >Reduced time to setup new web applications by over 70% and
          significantly enhanced developer experience</strong
        >
        by employing a ‘Principle’ web application template, front-end had a
        centralized blueprint for our evolving standards, tooling, and common
        components. As new patterns emerged, all connected projects were
        automatically synced with a pull request.
      </li>
      <li>
        Revolutionized the front-end development workflow by
        <strong
          >automating non-coding activities throughout a ticket’s lifecycle from
          over an hour to less than five minutes, all without leaving VS
          Code.</strong
        >
        This breakthrough has been widely acclaimed by contractors and new hires
        as a new benchmark in developer productivity and developer experience.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fostered exceptional growth and development within my software
        engineering team,
        <strong
          >facilitating more engineering job promotions than all other technical

          and adopted company-wide.</strong
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong
          >Reduced onboarding new software engineer’s from 60 days to a 14
          days</strong
        >
        by running an onboarding procedure full of ever evolving automations,
        scripts, and tooling, a new engineer’s machine was provisioned within a
        few hours, allowing them to code their first day
      </li>
      <li>
        Dramatically improved our engineering hiring process by introducing a
        “Hiring Matrix”,
        <strong
          >we set new department standards in efficient and inclusive hiring
          practices</strong
        >. Evolving from hundreds of interviews, we routinely iterated and
        improved the system based on feedback from recruiters and engineers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Directed alongside 3 other engineering managers the rapid and
        <strong
          >successful response to a state-sponsored ransomware attack. Achieved
          100% data recovery without ransom payment in just four days.</strong
        >
        Coordinating with senior leadership, cyber insurance, and the FBI, we
        processed complete system scans to ensure service continuity for
        hundreds of clients and employees, maintaining all SLAs and securing
        client trust.
      </li>
      <li>
        Standardized our front-end continuous integration system across our
        catalog of products By leveraging GitHub’s enterprise features and
        closely collaborating with our dev ops team. We reimagined the pull
        request process and deployments to be faster and higher in quality.
        There is an increasing list of efficiencies covering 12 “health checks”
        ranging in areas from automated testing, security, seo, web performance,
        and more to ensure the highest level of quality is delivered.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong
          >Cut the annual digital product development budget by nearly 50%,
          saving the department over $14,000</strong
        >, by using a zero-based budgeting process, we eliminated many
        unnecessary expenses and strategically shifted to more cost effective
        platforms like Jira, Github, and a new negotiated contract with
        Browserstack.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong
          >Led User Privacy Compliance Overhaul on our entire portfolio of 40+

        regulations, collaborated with key stakeholders, vendors and trained 3
        teams in Privacy-First best practices.

        <strong
          >Planned and supervised a successful 3 month enterprise migration from
          Bitbucket to Github.com</strong
        >
        by grooming our 400+ repositories, we succeeded in moving 250 of our
        active repositories while coordinating with lead engineers from each
